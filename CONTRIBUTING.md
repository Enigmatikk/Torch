## Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs, please include:
- Rust version (`rustc --version`)
- Torch version
- Operating system
- Minimal code example that reproduces the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior

## Feature Requests

We love hearing about new ideas! When suggesting features:
- Explain the use case and why it's valuable
- Consider if it fits with Torch's goals (performance, security, simplicity)
- Think about backwards compatibility
- Provide examples of how the API might look

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, inclusive, and constructive. We want Torch to be a welcoming project for everyone.

## Questions?
