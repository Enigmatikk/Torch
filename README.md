## Installation

```bash
pip install torch-ml
```

For GPU support:

```bash
pip install torch-ml[cuda]
```

## Quick Start

```python
import torch
from torch import nn
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

# Define a simple neural network
class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.linear_relu_stack = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(28*28, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, 10)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.flatten(x)
        logits = self.linear_relu_stack(x)
        return logits

# Initialize model and move to GPU if available
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = NeuralNetwork().to(device)

# Load data
training_data = datasets.MNIST(
    root="data",
    train=True,
    download=True,
    transform=transforms.ToTensor(),
)
test_data = datasets.MNIST(
    root="data",
    train=False,
    download=True,
    transform=transforms.ToTensor(),
)
train_dataloader = DataLoader(training_data, batch_size=64)
test_dataloader = DataLoader(test_data, batch_size=64)

# Training setup
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

# Training loop
def train(dataloader, model, loss_fn, optimizer):
    size = len(dataloader.dataset)
    model.train()
    for batch, (X, y) in enumerate(dataloader):
        X, y = X.to(device), y.to(device)
        
        # Forward pass
        pred = model(X)
        loss = loss_fn(pred, y)
        
        # Backpropagation
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        if batch % 100 == 0:
            loss, current = loss.item(), batch * len(X)
            print(f"loss: {loss:>7f}  [{current:>5d}/{size:>5d}]")

# Start training
epochs = 5
for t in range(epochs):
    print(f"Epoch {t+1}\n-------------------------------")
    train(train_dataloader, model, loss_fn, optimizer)
print("Training complete!")
```
