- **Third-party Tools**: Connectors for popular business intelligence and analytics platforms
- **Export Options**: Multiple export formats including CSV, JSON, and PDF

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- PostgreSQL 12+ (for data storage)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Enigmatikk/Torch.git
cd Torch
```

2. Set up the virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```

4. Configure the environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration details
```

5. Initialize the database:
```bash
python scripts/init_db.py
```

6. Start the development server:
```bash
python app.py
```
