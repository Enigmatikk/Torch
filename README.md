# Torch Project

## Overview
Torch is a comprehensive data analytics and visualization platform designed to transform raw data into actionable insights. It empowers organizations to make data-driven decisions through intuitive dashboards, advanced analytics, and seamless data integration capabilities.

## Features

### Data Integration
- **Multiple Source Connectors**: Connect to databases, APIs, cloud storage, and file systems
- **Real-time Streaming**: Process and analyze data as it arrives
- **ETL Pipeline**: Extract, transform, and load data with customizable workflows

### Analytics Engine
- **Statistical Analysis**: Comprehensive statistical tools for data exploration
- **Machine Learning Models**: Built-in algorithms for predictive analytics
- **Custom Queries**: Advanced query builder for specific data insights

### Visualization
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating custom dashboards
- **Chart Library**: Extensive collection of visualization options
- **Sharing Capabilities**: Export and share insights across teams

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- MongoDB (v4.4+)
- Redis (v6+)
- Python (v3.8+) for analytics modules

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Enigmatikk/Torch.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd Torch

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Configuration
Edit the `.env` file to configure:
- Database connections
- API keys
- Service ports
- Logging preferences

## Architecture

Torch follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

1. **API Gateway**: Manages authentication and routes requests
2. **Data Service**: Handles data ingestion and storage
3. **Analytics Engine**: Processes data and runs models
4. **Visualization Service**: Renders dashboards and charts
5. **User Management**: Handles permissions and user settings

## Development

### Project Structure
```

├── user-mgmt/      # User management and authentication
├── common/         # Shared utilities and models
└── docs/           # Documentation
```

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branches from `develop`
2. Submit PRs for code review
3. Automated tests run on CI
4. Merge to `develop` after approval
5. Release candidates created from `develop`
6. Production releases merged to `main`

### Coding Standards
- ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Black for Python
- Jest for unit testing
- Cypress for E2E testing

## Deployment

### Docker
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t torch .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 torch
```

### Kubernetes
Helm charts are available in the `deployment/kubernetes` directory.

```bash
helm install torch ./deployment/kubernetes/torch
```
